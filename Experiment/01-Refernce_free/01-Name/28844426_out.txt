Once upon a time, in a sparkling forest, there lived a gentle unicorn named Luna who could paint the sky with her magical horn. One night, Luna shared her colors with a lonely star, helping it shine brighter than ever before. From that night on, they became the best of friends, lighting up the sky together and reminding all the creatures below that magic exists in friendship.
