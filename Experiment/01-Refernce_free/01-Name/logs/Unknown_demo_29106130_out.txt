Once upon a time, a gentle unicorn named Luna wandered through a sparkling meadow under a sky full of stars. One night, she found a lost little owl who needed help getting home, so she used her magical horn to create a glowing path in the darkness. Together, they traveled safely through the night, and from then on, they shared stories of friendship and adventure, shining brightly in each other's hearts.
