In a hidden forest glade, a gentle unicorn named Luna would sprinkle stardust on the flowers, making them glow under the moonlight. One night, as she danced among the blooms, she discovered a lost little star weeping for home. With a flick of her shimmering mane, Luna lifted the star into the sky, and together they sent a cascade of twinkling light across the night, reminding everyone that magic is real and dreams can always find their way home.
