Once upon a time, in a shimmering forest, there lived a gentle unicorn named Lila who could make flowers bloom with her magical horn.

As the bunny snuggled into its cozy burrow, Lila whispered a promise to always watch over her friends, and with a twinkle in her eye, she drifted off to sleep beneath the moonlight.
