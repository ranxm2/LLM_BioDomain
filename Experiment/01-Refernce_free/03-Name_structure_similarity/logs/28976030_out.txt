Once upon a time, in a shimmering forest, a gentle unicorn named Luna discovered a hidden glade filled with sparkling moonflowers. Each night, she danced among the blossoms, painting the sky with magic and light. One evening, as her sparkling hooves touched the ground, the stars winked down, and Luna realized her joy made the whole world glow brighter.
