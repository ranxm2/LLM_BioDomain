Once upon a time in a shimmering forest, a gentle unicorn named Luna discovered a hidden grove filled with sparkling flowers that glowed in the moonlight.

One starry evening, Luna wished on a shooting star, and from that moment on, the grove became a place where dreams came true for everyone in the forest.
