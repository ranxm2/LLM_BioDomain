Once upon a time, in a hidden forest, a kind unicorn named Luna roamed under the starlit sky, spreading glittering magic wherever she went. One night, she discovered a little lost star, twinkling sadly on the ground, and with a gentle nuzzle, she helped it find its way back to the heavens. From that day on, every night, the stars shined brighter, just to thank Luna for her kindness.
