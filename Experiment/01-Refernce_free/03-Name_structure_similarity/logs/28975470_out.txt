Once upon a time in a shimmering forest, a kind unicorn named Luna discovered a hidden glade where flowers danced under the moonlight. Every night, she would sprinkle magical stardust over the petals, making them glow and inviting all the woodland creatures to join her in a joyful celebration. As the stars twinkled above, they danced and laughed together, dreaming of new adventures in the enchanting night.
