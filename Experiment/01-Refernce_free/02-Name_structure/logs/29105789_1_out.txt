Once upon a time in a magical forest, a brave unicorn named Lila set off to find the lost stars that had fallen from the sky. With her shimmering horn, she gathered the stars and returned them to their rightful place, filling the night with twinkling light. As the forest sparkled with joy, Lila closed her eyes, knowing that her kindness had made the world a brighter place.
