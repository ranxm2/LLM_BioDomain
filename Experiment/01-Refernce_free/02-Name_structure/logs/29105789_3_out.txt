Once upon a time, a gentle unicorn named Luna roamed a vibrant enchanted forest, where her shimmering mane glowed with the colors of twilight. One starry night, she discovered a weeping willow that had lost its sparkle, so she sprinkled her magical stardust over it, bringing it back to life. From that day on, the tree blossomed with glowing flowers, and Luna knew that kindness was her greatest magic of all.
